# Pacman Intro

Pacman simulation of back and forth movement 

This project was designed to introduce the idea of back and forth movement created through simulation of a PacMan figure.

## Installation

To run the simulation, a browser with Javascript enabled is required (JS is enabled on most browsers by default).

## Usage

When the Pacman figure is clicked with the mouse, it will start moving from the right of the page to the left of the page and then reverse direction once the page boundary is reached.

## Support

For supporting with setting this project up on your machine, please send me a direct message.

## Roadmap
Future improvements include:
* Linking Pacman's movements with the arrow keys
* Adding ghosts for Pacman to avoid
* Adding a map for Pacman to move on
